# Node-Webkit Markdown Editor
A very simple Markdown editor created with Node Webkit. This code is part of a tutorial: <https://ducode.org/posts/node-webkit-tutorial-creating-a-markdown-editor/>. The code is released under the MIT license, so do what you want with the code.

The editor is more a stub than a complete Markdown editor. Use this as a base for your own Markdown editor.

## Installation

1. Obviously, download the code to your favourite location.
1. With the command line, go to the folder and run `npm install`. This will install the dependencies for the editor.
1. From <http://nwjs.io/>, download the right version of Node-Webkit and extract the contents to the folder.
1. Voila, you're done. You might want to read [something](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki/How-to-package-and-distribute-your-apps) about packaging and distributing Node-Webkit apps.
